    # PROGRAM NAME
    #   matrix
    # EXECUTION
    #   matrix OPERATION [ARGUMENT]...
    #   Performs the specified operation on 0 or more rectangular 
    #   matrix arguments and outputs the result to the console.
    # INPUTS
    #   matrix dims [MATRIX] - reads the file specified or a matrix provided
    #       via stdin
    #   matrix transpose [MATRIX] - reads the file specified or a matrix provided
    #       via stdin
    #   matrix mean [MATRIX] - reads the file specified or a matrix provided
    #       via stdin
    #   matrix add MATRIX_LEFT MATRIX_RIGHT
    #   matrix multiply MATRIX_LEFT MATRIX_RIGHT
    # OUTPUTS
    #   dims - prints the dimensions of the matrix as "[N rows] [M columns]"
    #   transpose - reflects the matrix along the main diagonal.
    #   mean - 1xN row vector, where the first element is the mean of column
    #           one, the second element is the mean of column two, and so on
    #   add - the element-wie sum of two MxN matrices 
    #   multiply - the product of an MxN matrix and NxP matrix
